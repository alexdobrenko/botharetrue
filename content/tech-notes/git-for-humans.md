## Writer's Brief (Outline)

> This section is a handoff for a writer — what the post is about and what to cover.

### The Hook
I finally understood Git when I stopped thinking about code and started thinking about parallel universes.

### Main Points to Cover
1. **Branches are parallel realities** — you can try something wild in one universe without affecting the main timeline
2. **Merging is the moment of truth** — changes stay isolated until you actively choose to combine them
3. **Git works for everything text-based** — essays, notes, project plans, recipes

### The Angle
Learning Git by actually getting confused, making branches, wondering why changes disappeared, then having the "oh THAT'S how it works" moment.

### Target Reader
Creative person who's heard of Git, maybe uses it minimally, but doesn't really *get* it. Especially: writers, note-takers, anyone who's thought "I wish I could see older versions of this doc."

### Tone Notes
Story-driven, personal discovery. The confusion is part of the story. Not a tutorial — more like "here's what clicked for me." Light, curious, maybe slightly amused at own confusion.


## The Story

I made a branch. Then another. Made some changes, committed them. Switched back to where I started.

The changes were gone.

I stared at the terminal like it had personally betrayed me. "I committed them. I watched the commit happen. Where did they go?"

Here's the thing nobody tells you about Git: the changes didn't go anywhere. They're still there, sitting on their branch, exactly where I left them. But I wasn't on that branch anymore. I was on a different branch. A different version of reality.

That's when it clicked.

Branches aren't like saving different drafts of a document. They're parallel universes. And each universe has its own version of every file. You can hop between them, but you only see what exists in the universe you're currently standing in.

The merge — the moment you combine branches — that's when the universes collide. That's when your test-branch reality gets folded into your main reality.

Before that? Total isolation. You could delete everything, set fire to the codebase, completely wreck your branch. Main branch doesn't care. It's in a different dimension.

I think I'd always assumed commits just... stacked up somewhere. Like a save history. But it's more spatial than that. More parallel.

The weird part is this works for anything. Essays. Notes. Project plans. Anything that's text. I could branch my essay, try a completely different intro, hate it, and switch back to the original without ever touching it. It's still there. Different universe.

I don't know why it took me this long to get it. Maybe because everyone explains Git like a filing system when it's actually more like science fiction.
