## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### What This Does

Research a podcast guest's social media presence across platforms, analyze their actual posting style, and draft LinkedIn copy that sounds like them—not like a marketing team wrote it.

### The Prompts

**Research phase:**
```
Can you research the details for [Guest] across social platforms and for [Company] across socials? And what other channels they might have - email newsletters etc
```

**Voice analysis:**
```
Can you search thru what [Guest] posts on his own LinkedIn to see if we have precedent for how to do this?
```

**Drafting:**
```
Write it now more in [Guest's] voice from the transcript of the podcast and from his prior social posts
```

### What Claude Does

1. Searches LinkedIn, X, Instagram for guest + company presence
2. Fetches actual post content to analyze length, tone, structure
3. Identifies patterns (e.g., "he always thanks the interviewer first")
4. Pulls key quotes from podcast transcript
5. Drafts post matching their actual voice
6. Iterates based on feedback (length, angle, structure)

**After (matched to guest's actual style):**
