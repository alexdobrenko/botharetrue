## Writer's Brief (Outline)

> This section is a handoff for a writer — what the post is about and what to cover.

### The Hook
I needed slides for my course in 3 hours and had nothing but a messy outline with random thoughts and screenshots pasted in.

### Main Points to Cover
1. The outline was garbage — just "fuck that shit" and half-formed ideas — and that was fine
2. Claude turned messy notes into 18 slides with a consistent "weird 90s PowerPoint" vibe
3. The meta moment: one of the slides was literally about making these slides

### The Angle
Personal discovery / happy accident. "I didn't know this was possible and now I can't go back to making slides manually."

### Target Reader
Creative people who hate making presentations but have to give them. People who have Claude but haven't used it for visual stuff.

### Tone Notes
Casual, self-deprecating about the chaos, amused by the result. Lean into the weirdness of AI making slides about AI.


## The Story

I'm teaching a course that starts tomorrow and I have no slides.

Well, I have an outline. It says things like "What this will not be: 10x your productivity" and then underneath it just says "fuck that shit." There are three screenshots pasted in with Obsidian's unhelpful naming convention: "Pasted image 20260128052639.png."

This is not a presentation. This is the inside of my brain having a mild panic attack.

So I asked Claude to make it into slides. Not "help me make slides" — actually make them. The whole thing. I described the vibe I wanted: "playful & weird, 90s PowerPoint energy, bold colors." I listed the sections. I said things like "add a chaos meter that shows chaos going from 230% to 55%."

Twenty minutes later I had an 18-slide PPTX file on my computer. It has a consistent color palette. The images are embedded. There's a slide that just says "FUCK THAT SHIT" in huge pink letters on a cream background.

One of the slides is called "Making these slides" with "METAAAAAA" underneath it. That felt appropriate.

The weirdest part wasn't that it worked. The weirdest part was watching the validation errors: "Text element <p> has background. Backgrounds only supported on <div> elements." Claude fixed it and tried again. Then: "Text box ends too close to bottom edge." Fixed. Tried again. Done.

I watched my presentation debug itself.

I'm still not sure if this is cool or terrifying but I have slides now.
