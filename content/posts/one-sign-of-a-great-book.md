While reading it, you start to think and write in the voice of that book. That happened fast with Lily King’s “Heart the Lover." 

Because then I'm still going to be 99% me or 90%, but that adjustment is so cool. 

That's one of the best things books can do, especially when you read it first thing in the morning. I think that's a big part of why that worked this morning - it was the first thing i read this morning.
