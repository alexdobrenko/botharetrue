this is, strangely, a huge deal. 

or not strangely, but just interestingly given how common of a thing that is. everyone is posting onto youtube all the time. 

and yet for me it felt impossible. until now (dramatic)

i decided to run an experiment this morning at about 530am - could i record and publish a video in 30 min. 

the result: no. 

but i could in about an hour, give or take. 

that time restraint helped a TON because it stopped me from getting caught up in two places particularly that usually slow/halt my progress: 

1. the edit - I ran the vid thru timebolt which i'm testing out for removing silences. it's a p good tool. 
	1. I did a manual scrub of the footage and brought back some pauses that i felt were comedically effective and then i exported to premiere 
	2. here's where i'd usually get stuck. i'd comb thru the cut and try to fine tune it, lose a few seconds here, tinker there, but it would 100% be useless and eventually i'd get distracted or EJ would wake up and I'd leave it undone
		1. it would become a new albotross around my neck!! (that's what the video is about lol)
2. the YT optimization - thumbnail, title, etc. 
	1. this can take me forever because i immediately tell myself i suck at it AND that it's a big deal (a v bad combo)
	2. so i just took a picture of myself, threw it into canva, made a title using a template, and bam put it up. 
	3. I wanted it to be a weird thumbnail so i made it weird. 
	4. i could see that thumbnail becoming my house style now, or maybe it wont - doesn't matter - point is, i feel good about it. 

And now the video is up and its 632am and I'm here about to finish a recap ON the video. 

All of this feels a little...self-gaze? navel-involved? who cares. that's not for me to really figure out.
