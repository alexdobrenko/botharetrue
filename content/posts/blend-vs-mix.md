I just want to give a big shout out to the word 'blend.' Coffee is a blend. I just made a blend when i took beans from two different bags and tossed it all into my grinder. That is a blend!

The word blend is powerful. It is a marketing word.

Imagine if you were paying for a 'coffee mix' - I would not pay top dollar for that.

Blend though, now blend sounds good.

Blend I'd pay for.

Premium blend.

It's all in the language!!
