When thinking about mastery, for myself, there seem to be two frames:

1. How do I define what it means to strive for learning, for mastery?
2. How well am I following that rubric / framework for any given essay?

I think I need to figure out #1 first, or at least have some sense of it, in order to give it a whirl. But I also need to not be too prescriptive. Who knows what'll happen when I write.

Here's the latest 'rubric' I've created for myself when writing something new. I've used it twice now and the results have been pretty awesome.

## On choosing what to write about

- **Is it something I'm not sure the answer to**, e.g. this whole thing with Fogchaser and dancing for the algorithm but also wanting to support him on there.
- **Does the question / topic propel me forward** (vs being propelled by how it will externally be received)?

## On starting the process
- Did I spend some time hand writing the ideas?

## On the process
- Am I open to the possibility of being surprised and having the essay go wherever the hell it wants to go?

## On editing

(To be filled in as I develop this further)

## Right before publishing
- Am I clear on how I feel personally about the essay?
- Am I clear on how well I followed the rubric / concepts here?
- How do I feel broadly about writing?

## Questions I'm not sure about

Is this the best way to be spending my time?

What's the goal of this work?
