# just ask claude


Here's what's actually changing: you think you can't solve this stuff. And you probably can.

And if you can't, Claude can help. Or someone on the internet can help. The information is out there. The capability is out there.

I'm not saying it'll be easy. Some people have a stronger technical awareness. A depth to it. But that's also where people like me can help.

Because one of the traps of "just ask Claude" is that it'll lead you in bad directions.

I've been doing this for less than a year, but I've started to develop a spidey sense. When it's the blind leading the blind. When I'm headed somewhere useful versus somewhere dumb.

That's something you develop over time. You learn as you go. You're not going to figure it out in one day.


But what I'm realizing I can help people with is this:

The fundamental concepts. And the leaps of faith.

Not leaps of faith in Claude.

Leaps of faith in themselves. And in the process.

That's the thing. Believing you can figure it out. Believing that even when it's frustrating and you've been stuck for hours, you're still learning. You're still getting somewhere.

That's what I can help with.
