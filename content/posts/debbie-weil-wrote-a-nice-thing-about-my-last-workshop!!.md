There's a special magic when someone writes something based on an idea you shared with them. 

That's what happened when Debbie wrote about the ideas from my funny/vulnerable workshop. 
Here's her full unedited post which you can also [read here:](https://debbieweil.substack.com/p/permission-to-be-boring) 

>**Alex explained that this is called a “tilt” – it’s when things get interesting.** We talked about tilts a lot; they’re a common feature of improv comedy. It’s when you’ve got an established scene (two people on a park bench, for example), and then one says something that “tilts” the scene into absurdity. Tilts can happen in writing even when it’s not humor writing, per se. They’re what turn the “boring and obvious” into something surprising and intriguing.

I liked this definition of tilts that Alex gave us:
>
>> When your energy or tone suddenly shifts — a tiny crack that shows something real, something weird, something surprising.
>>
>> It is when the music gets faster.
