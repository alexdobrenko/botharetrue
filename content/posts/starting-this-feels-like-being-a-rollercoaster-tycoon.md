The whole process of creating my own blog/home outside Substack feels like RollerCoaster Tycoon. Iâ€™m inviting people into the park, but nothing is actually built, and everybody is going to be vomiting up the side. 

Truth be told, I haven't even started to invite people. I haven't opened the park. I kind of don't want to. I sort of want it to feel like a park you have to stumble upon to use the parlance of an old URL. But then I am also creating the loops and I do want to move people through them. I just have a lot of doubt about that. 

Loops, by the way, here is the email tool that I'm using instead of Kit, which I canceled. Because honestly, fuck that place. 

More on this soon....
