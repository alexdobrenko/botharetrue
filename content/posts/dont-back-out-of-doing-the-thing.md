Almost every day that there's a BATWRITE, I think about how I can back out of it. 

I'll just say I'm too busy. Or I'll tell people I don't feel good. I can't do it, I just can't. 

And then, I do. I'm in one right now, as I write this, and it's going great. They always do. 

So what's up with the fear? Is it just the normal stagefright that I feel before doing basically anything? Like how before going to hang out with my friends I'll think, 'ugh I don't want to do this' even though I very much do?

Yes. 

I know this, and I also know that it probably won't go away any time soon. Maybe, but I'm not gonna expect anything. 

Instead I will just get better at remembering that the way I think I'll feel once I do something and how I actually feel while doing it are often, almost always, very different. 

Not necessarily even in a positive direction - something I think will be awesome will end up sucking. That's fine too. It's all fine, just like the dog in the fire said:
