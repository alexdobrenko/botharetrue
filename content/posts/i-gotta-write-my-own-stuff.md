I keep trying to take shortcuts - that's one of the main things AI can help with, after all. And one place I keep trying and failing is writing.

Like with [this essay](/posts/just-ask-claude/). I tried by first doing a voice note and having it turn the voice note into an essay and I just...didn't like it. It didn't feel like me, even if the prompt I gave was "sound like me."

Or maybe it DID sound like me and I didn't like that either.

I figured hey, I'll treat it like an editor. Andy Worhol had people do his art for him under his leadership and vision, why can't I do that with AI?

(I'm nalways comparing myself to Andy Worhol- he's like such a classic me)

But still, it doesn't work, because a lot of my best writing comes in the weird reactions to the writing itself.

Like the andy worhol thing. That's a true thought I had, but I wouldn't have remembered having it without actually writing out these words.

So yea, I'm making a rule for myself: write it all yourself. I'll still do voice notes, sure, but then I'll turn them into pieces of writing. No AI, not with the writing.

Plus I love writing. I love this, here, the fingers punching the keys into words, the words blending into ideas and sentences that explode the mind into feeling and understanding and emotion and everything else, all at once.

Maybe AI can do that to you, the reader, but it can't do it to me, the writer. And I venture to guess that if its not happening for me, its not gonna happen for you either.

So yea, I'm gonna just write everything, even and actually especially for all the AI stuff I'm doing now over here: code for creatives.

I'll post soon about why I am doing that, and what I'm excited about etc.

but for now, yes, just this, a guideline for myself: write the stuff and let your soul be free.

If you wanna see the difference between these, btw, here's the original I published that used the "voice note → AI edit → Alex edit" approach:

- [just ask claude (ai-assisted draft)](/posts/just-ask-claude/) - the AI-assisted version
- [just ask claude](/posts/asking-claude/) - the version I wrote myself
