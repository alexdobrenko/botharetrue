Reading more of her this morning and I don't want to stop. There is a joy in her words, an aliveness, that is contagious. I feel as though she does not want to stop writing, and thus, perhaps, I don't want to stop reading.

The topics vary wildly from why armed forces wear uniforms to the paucity of 'growth' as the prevailing metaphor for our entire way of being and doing. No matter the details though, I want to keep reading.

This feels like a good north star for my own writing: to find the topics and methods of writing that allow for such streams to burst forth through me and onto the page. Substack, lately, feels like that no longer. It feels stifling. Scary. Unfree.

Maybe though by writing here on this blog, I can release the streams (ew) of ideas such that Substack has less pressure on it? That feels like a worthy theory and one I'll add to the goals for the blog as an experiment.
