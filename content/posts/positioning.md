I'm reading this book - a classic in the marketing world, apparently, called Positioning. Here's a lil bit from the intro:

Positioning has changed the way the advertising game is being played today.

“We’re the third largest-selling coffee in America,” say the Sanka radio commercials.

The third largest? Whatever happened to those good old advertising words like “first” and “best” and “finest”?

Well, the good old advertising days are gone forever and so are the words. Today you find comparatives, not superlatives.

“Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.”

“Seven-Up: the uncola.”

Along Madison Avenue, these are called positioning slogans. And the advertising people who write them spend their time and research money looking for positions, or holes, in the marketplace.

But positioning has stirred up interest well beyond Madison Avenue. With good reason.

Anyone can use positioning strategy to get ahead in the game of life. And look at it this way: If you don’t understand and use the principles, your competitors undoubtedly will.
