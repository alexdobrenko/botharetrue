God I hope I can stick to these.

The first that just came to mind is: no analytics. No knowing which posts do "best." 

But isn't that...useful? For people who come here? 

damn it I'm already folding like a lawn chair. 

well, that's not really a problem right now - no one reads this, and I sort of want to keep it that way. 

well, A PART of me wants to keep it that way while another part of course wants people to read this and it grow. 

Both are true, and always will be. 

But the realization from that I think is simply that you need a release valve - you need a quiet place to call your own. Isabel and I have chatted a lot about that, how artists need a little cave of their own, a trickster hideaway for goofs. 

Another cool idea maybe even worth making a video for?
