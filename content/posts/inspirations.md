As I venture forth into this new wilderness, I find myself returning again and again to influences and inspirations.

Specifically, I want to write them down, for myself, and share them, for y'all. It's way too easy to forget about them in the maelstrom of the day, the hubbub of the night.

So, in no particular order, here are some people whose work inspires me and to whom I look when thinking about this next chapter:

- Robin Sloan
- Kristoffer Njave
- Seth Werkheiser
- Matt of Web Curios
- Cody Cook Parrott
- Kening Zhu
- Molly whatever her name is - I love her website so much.

*(This is a living post - one I'll come back to - not sure if I need to categorize that differently but leaving this as a note for myself right now)*
