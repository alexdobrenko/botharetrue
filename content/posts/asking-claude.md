So I just got off a call with someone interested in learning all the claude code stuff.

It was fun and cool and i muttered a lot, laughed too loud, and was generally anxious about sounding smart or making myself look like anything other than an idiot. Healthy stuff!

But, and, yet, the one thing i kept saying as an answer to this kind friend's questions was simply this:

## just ask claude

Not sure how to install something on github? Just ask claude.

Can't figure out what you might use claude code for? Just ask claude.

Wondering what the hell a 'markdown file' is and how your life got to this point? Just ask claude.

And as we say in the locksmith community, that is a big 'unlock.'

## asker, beware

While this is true, and it is what I recommend, I also must warn you: trusting the AI to lead you, especially when you're starting out in a new domain, can feels like the blind leading the blind.

Except the blind that you're being led by is VERY good at convincing you that it can see. In fact, it cannot tell you that it has no idea what it's doing because that's not really part of its DNA.

And so you'll follow it down dark roads that lead not simply nowhere but so far away from where you want to go that you'll be confused as fuck as to how you got there. Like asking Google Maps to go from Boston to NY and ending up on a plane to Sydney because there's a great new direct flight from Sydney to NY.

Will you get to NY? Sure, but...

## but it's not that scary

You learn as you go and you can always just quit out and start over. That was another thing I realized from this convo: people think the stakes are higher than they are. You can't do all that much damage.

So yea, try it out. Follow the blind until you both can see.
