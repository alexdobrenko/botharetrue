I wrote that recently in a little note about prepping for a workshop. 

I love seeing past me being so giddy about something. About enjoying the process of creating slides for my presentations. 

And it's true - I remember the feeling - it's like this different form of basically writing where I'm creating something and using the medium's tools to make it as funny and good and weird as I can. 

More of this, and more noticing when the getting is good.
