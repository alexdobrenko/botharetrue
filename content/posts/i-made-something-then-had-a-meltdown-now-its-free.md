ok so here's what happened.

I've been vibe coding for like a year. I have a captioning tool that's 70% done. a game. a blog system. all of them "almost there." none of them shipped.

so I made myself a little system. one project at a time. everything else is dormant. write it down. actually write it down. and it worked. I shipped a zine in one day that had been sitting untouched for weeks.

then I thought: other people have this problem. I should sell this.

so I made a gumroad page. $99. put together a whole thing. video walkthrough. setup guide. the works.

posted it to a small subreddit to test. got deleted for self-promo.

and then I spiraled. like full manic spiral. checking my email for sales that weren't coming. checking reddit. checking whatsapp to see if anyone responded to my message about it. looking for a hit.

the funniest part is nobody had even really seen it yet. but it already felt like a failure. the failure feeling came before any actual failure.

I was driving to a thing with my family and I couldn't be present. my wife asked what was wrong and I didn't even know how to explain it. "do you know what vibe coding is?" she said no. great.

anyway. I realized a few things:

1. trying to sell something to strangers who don't know me is a shitty way to make money
2. the spiral wasn't about the product. the spiral just wanted the spiral.
3. the thing actually is useful and I still want people to have it

so now it's free: [Ship the Vibe on Gumroad](https://alexdobrenko.gumroad.com/l/shipthevibe)

it's a claude code command that helps you brain dump all your projects, pick ONE to be primary, and actually ship it. simple. stupidly simple. but that's kind of the point.

if you're drowning in half-finished stuff maybe it helps. or maybe it doesn't. I don't know. but it helped me and now I'm not trying to sell you anything so you can just have it.
