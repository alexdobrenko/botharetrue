From Tom White's piece [Everything Has Been Said (But Not By You)](https://www.whitenoise.email/p/everything-has-been-said-but-not)

>Because truth doesnâ€™t live on the page.  
IIt lives in the speaking.  
IIn the wrestling.  
IIn the failing and the finding your way back.  
>
>It dies in repetition without revelation,  
iin articulation without authenticity.
>
Anyone can carry a tune.  
Only you can give it meaning.
>
So say it again.  
Say it like you mean it.  
Say it until itâ€™s yours.
