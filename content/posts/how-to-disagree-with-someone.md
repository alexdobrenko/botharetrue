My distraction of choice lately has been hacker-news which feels to me the way I bet comedy twitter feels to a scientist. Super interesting without a hint of jealousy about why they didn't come up with the "butt as head" meme. 

(that's not a real meme btw, at least not yet)

anyway, most of the stuff on there is blog posts from people. usually i'll then spend some time looking at the person's other posts, which is how I came upon this piece by Mario Zechner:

I'm not sure what it's about, honestly, but I loved the intro so much: 

> _I consider Armin a friend, so the following is me just rambling at him like I would over a coffee in real life. I most likely just misunderstood his blog post. [Read his post first to make any sense of mine.](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/11/22/llm-apis/) Here's a shitty TL;DR: He claims LLM APIs are secretly a state synchronization problem because providers support prefix caching and hide state from you, and proposes we look at local-first/CRDT-style solutions._

> Armin, I'm gonna wall of text you. Think of me as one of your [slightly demented, contrarian HN-style blog post bot reviewers](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/30/how-i-ai/).

There's so much good in there. So much love. He assumes that he's probably wrong (I most likely misunderstood you) but then still writes as though he's right. And it's not personal. Or it knows that it very well might be interpreted as personal and thus gets ahead of that scenario with this message. 

Above all, it's just nice. Kind. 

I want to disagree more like this. To write about things I don't like or understand but with the love and care I would a friend. 

Okay, that's all. Good day, my friends, and may we all disagree like Mario and Armin.
