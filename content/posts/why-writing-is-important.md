so I just wrote this little piece - [having is evidence of wanting](https://botharetrue.com/posts/having-is-evidence-of-wanting/). 

it's not a full essay, not even close, but it is...something. 

and that matters. 

how do i know? 

because i just a few minutes ago had a random thought pop into my mind about how i could use this idea - having is evidence of wanting - and the book Existential Kink as a whole - as the start of the story I can tell at the February 2026 Moth show that's coming up. The theme is 'Love Hurts.' I don't yet know what my piece will be about, but now I have a super interesting, alive-feeling start. 

would that have happened if i hadn't written it down? who cares. it did happen, and i did write it down. onwards.
