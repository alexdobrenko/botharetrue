# How I'm Testing My New Email Provider (Loops)

So here’s what I did.

## 1. First Stop: Mail-Tester
I went to **mail-tester.com**, grabbed the weird little temporary email address they gave me, added it to my Loops list, and sent my email.  

Score came back great. 9.5/10. Huge win.

## 2. Then I Tried My Personal Gmail
I added my own personal email to the Loops list because I wanted to see where it *actually* lands in a real inbox.

It didn’t go to Spam (yay), but it also didn’t hit my inbox.  
Instead it went to this weird purgatory: **All Mail**.

No clue why Gmail does this, but it’s not the inbox and it’s not spam… it’s like the middle child.

## 3. So Now the Question Is: How Do I Fix That?
And honestly… I don’t know if I *can* fully fix that myself. At least not instantly.


I’m now going to run some tests by asking 10 friends to help me out.
