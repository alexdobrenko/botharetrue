That's the first axiom in the book Existential Kink which I've just started reading based on a rec from Paul Millerd. 

The basic idea here being - whatever situation you've got in life, there's a part of you, deep down in the caverns of your sticky subconscious, that wants it that way. 

My mind quickly gets stuck in the logistics of it, the logic of it, which I think the author Carolyn Elliott would say is a trap. That's the ego wanting to make sense of things, but none of this makes sense. That's how it works. It operates beyond and outside of the rules of logic and reason where 2+2 = farts. 

It's hard to write about this stuff because language operates on logic, at baseline, but it also has the capacity to transcend it. Again though, see? I'm doing it again, trying to make it make sense. 

STOP MAKING SENSE - Talking Heads. 

I share this here as a way to remind myself that I'm doing this, and to try to bring these ideas to the forefront of my mind. 

Carolyn Elliott's theory is basically: if you embrace the weird, fucked up desires of your unconscious (subconscious? idk the diff), then you create inside yourself an alignment between the two parts of you and, inside of this acceptance, allow yourself the possibility to transcend those patterns. 

Though isn't that just a complicated way of trying to run from them? (my ego asks)

Maybe. I'm just trying it out. Like a new suit. Let's see what happens.
