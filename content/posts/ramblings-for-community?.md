Just read this awesome short essay [Ramblings](https://stephango.com/ramblings) from Obsidian CEO Steph Agno in which he (until v recently I assumed Steph was a woman) shares how at their work they have individual channels for each person called ramblings where each person can just write out whatever stuff they're thinking about and working on: 

>A tip for remote teams of 2-10 people. Create a personal “ramblings” channel for each teammate in your team’s chat app of choice.
>
Ramblings channels let everyone share what’s on their mind without cluttering group channels. Think of them as personal journals or microblogs inside your team’s chat app, a lightweight way to add ambient social cohesion.
>
People typically post short updates 1-3 times per week. Common topics include:
>
ideas related to current projects
>* musings about blog posts, articles, user feedback
>* “what if” suggestions
> * photos from recent trips or hobbies
> * rubber ducking a problem
>
>Each ramblings channel should be named after the team member, and only that person can post top-level messages. Others can reply in threads, but not start new ones.
>
All the ramblings channels should be in a Ramblings section at the bottom of the channel list. They should be muted by default, with no expectation that anyone else will read them.

I love this idea. Makes me wonder if it'd work for communities too? Like if I got a bunch of writers together in an online space, something i've been maybe wanting to do for a little while now, and just let people sorta ramble and think aloud with the hopes that others might chime in? 

I worry though about how many people something like this could hold.
