Love this line so much from "not always so" by Shunryu Suzuki.

And the line he says a bit earlier: "if you go to the rest room, there is a chance for enlightenment."

But when you go to the restroom and seek shelter inside your phone, there is no chance for enlightenment. Of course there is, still, because the person who is looking in their phone is also enlightened but he does not know it to be so.

Enlightenment, then, is knowing that you are enlightened, and certain things seem to make that much harder to realize than others.
