I just came across this weird fun little mind puzzler:

Besides the many things I love about this website, made by coder / hacker / weird guy Nolan Royalty (see the footnote thing he does), I'm also just very drawn to trying to solve this. So before I look for the answer, I'm gonna try to solve it myself. 

If you wanna try, don't read below. 

## my answer 

I think the move is to ask Bob if Alice is lying. He'll tell you the truth 80% of the time. You can then ask Alice if Bob is lying or not and she'll tell you the truth 80% of the time. 

I'm too lazy to prove this with math, but I feel like her revealing whether or not Bob is lying will increase the total odds above 80%? 

## the real answer

Ok, I'm gonna scroll to the real answer now...

FUCK I WAS WAY WRONG!!!!

The answer is that it's the same 80%! 

I think this means I need to apply to the Recurse Center's coding retreat which it describes as a writer's retreat for programmers. 

Note to self: apply, but don't lie.
