Hi it's me Alex. Did you know that you can paste images into Claude Code with control-v (instead of command v)?

This is big because pasting screenshots is half of how I use the dang AI these days.

Lemme tell ya.

## Mac (macOS)

- Use **Ctrl+V** (not Command+V).
- This lets you paste screenshots or copied images directly into Claude Code blocks.

## Windows (PC)

- Use **Alt+V** (per recent updates).
- Works the same way: paste screenshots from your clipboard into Claude Code.

## Linux / WSL Caveat

Some users report image paste doesn't always work in terminal environments. If that's you, you may need to fall back on drag-and-drop or file upload until it's patched.

## Why It Matters

Being able to **paste images directly into Claude Code** is a game-changer:

- Developers can share bug screenshots instantly.
- Writers and creators can embed visuals in notes.
- No more fumbling with manual uploads.

So next time you're wondering _"how do I paste screenshots into Claude Code on Mac or Windows?"_â€”the answer is:

- **Mac:** Ctrl+V
- **Windows:** Alt+V

That's the trick. Your Claude Code workflow just got smoother.
