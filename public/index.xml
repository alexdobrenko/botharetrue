      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you inside the work or outside the work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s basically another way of talking about status and mastery, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a nice shortcut. Where are you? Are you in it—actually doing the thing—or are you outside, staring at the finished product, obsessing over how other people are going to receive it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new theory is this: the only real home is inside. That&amp;rsquo;s the only place you can actually live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blend vs Mix</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just want to give a big shout out to the word &amp;lsquo;blend.&amp;rsquo; Coffee is a blend. I just made a blend when i took beans from two different bags and tossed it all into my grinder. That is a blend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word blend is powerful. It is a marketing word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you were paying for a &amp;lsquo;coffee mix&amp;rsquo; - I would not pay top dollar for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blend though, now blend sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading her book right now, No Time To Spare, and am filled with this familiar feeling of how it feels when you&amp;rsquo;re reading someone and just feel&amp;hellip;seen. Understood, yes, but more than that, like your own way of understanding itself is being reflected back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, she&amp;rsquo;s just smart and I like how her brain moves ideas around, how it thinks and how she shares that thinking with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
