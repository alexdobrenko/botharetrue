      <description>&lt;p&gt;ok so here&amp;rsquo;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been vibe coding for like a year. I have a captioning tool that&amp;rsquo;s 70% done. a game. a blog system. all of them &amp;ldquo;almost there.&amp;rdquo; none of them shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I made myself a little system. one project at a time. everything else is dormant. write it down. actually write it down. and it worked. I shipped a zine in one day that had been sitting untouched for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
