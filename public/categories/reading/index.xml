      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m%20reading%20this%20book%20-%20a%20classic%20in%20the%20marketing%20world,%20apparently,%20called%20Positioning.%20Here&amp;rsquo;s%20a%20lil%20bit%20from%20the%20intro:%20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;%20[!from%20the%20book]
%20Positioning%20has%20changed%20the%20way%20the%20advertising%20game%20is%20being%20played%20today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;%20“We’re%20the%20third%20largest-selling%20coffee%20in%20America,”%20say%20the%20Sanka%20radio%20commercials.
%20
%20The%20third%20largest?%20Whatever%20happened%20to%20those%20good%20old%20advertising%20words%20like%20“first”%20and%20“best”%20and%20“finest”?
%20
%20Well,%20the%20good%20old%20advertising%20days%20are%20gone%20forever%20and%20so%20are%20the%20words.%20Today%20you%20find%20comparatives,%20not%20superlatives.
%20
%20“Avis%20is%20only%20No.%202%20in%20rent-a-cars,%20so%20why%20go%20with%20us?%20We%20try%20harder.”
%20
%20“Seven-Up:%20the%20uncola.”
%20
%20Along%20Madison%20Avenue,%20these%20are%20called%20positioning%20slogans.%20And%20the%20advertising%20people%20who%20write%20them%20spend%20their%20time%20and%20research%20money%20looking%20for%20positions,%20or%20holes,%20in%20the%20marketplace.
%20
%20But%20positioning%20has%20stirred%20up%20interest%20well%20beyond%20Madison%20Avenue.%20With%20good%20reason.
%20
%20Anyone%20can%20use%20positioning%20strategy%20to%20get%20ahead%20in%20the%20game%20of%20life.%20And%20look%20at%20it%20this%20way:%20If%20you%20don’t%20understand%20and%20use%20the%20principles,%20your%20competitors%20undoubtedly%20will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes%20me%20want%20to%20call%20Both%20Are%20True%20the%20&amp;quot;66th%20biggest%20comedy%20newsletter%20on%20Substack.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So%20this%20actor%20and%20writer%20Richard%20Ayoade%20wrote%20a%20book%20called%20The%20Unfinished%20Harauld%20Hughes%20which%20is%20about%20a%20writer%20of%20books%20and%20screenplays%20and%20other%20things.%20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And%20as%20part%20of%20writing%20that%20book,%20Ayoade%20also%20wrote%20and%20published%20actual%20books%20by%20his%20fictional%20character%20Harauld%20Hughes!!!%20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s%20Wallace%20Shawn%20explaining%20what%20Ayoade%20did:%20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_many%20writers%20have%20invented%20characters%20who%20are%20writers—but%20do%20you%20know%20any%20other%20writer%20who%20has%20not%20only%20invented%20a%20character%20who%20is%20a%20writer%20but%20who%20has%20then%20gone%20on%20to%20actually%20write%20and%20publish%20that%20imaginary%20writer’s%20complete%20works?%20Richard%20Ayoade%20has%20done%20that,%20and%20if%20you%20take%20out%20your%20Kindle%20and%20look%20up%20Harauld%20Hughes,%20Faber%20will%20be%2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>More on Ursula K. Le Guin</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-on-ursula-k-le-guin/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-on-ursula-k-le-guin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading more of her this morning and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop. There is a joy in her words, an aliveness, that is contagious. I feel as though she does not want to stop writing, and thus, perhaps, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics vary wildly from why armed forces wear uniforms to the paucity of &amp;lsquo;growth&amp;rsquo; as the prevailing metaphor for our entire way of being and doing. No matter the details though, I want to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ursula K. Le Guin Appreciation Post</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ursula-k-le-guin-appreciation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading her book right now, No Time To Spare, and am filled with this familiar feeling of how it feels when you&amp;rsquo;re reading someone and just feel&amp;hellip;seen. Understood, yes, but more than that, like your own way of understanding itself is being reflected back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, she&amp;rsquo;s just smart and I like how her brain moves ideas around, how it thinks and how she shares that thinking with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
