      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading this book - a classic in the marketing world, apparently, called Positioning. Here&amp;rsquo;s a lil bit from the intro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning has changed the way the advertising game is being played today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re the third largest-selling coffee in America,&amp;rdquo; say the Sanka radio commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third largest? Whatever happened to those good old advertising words like &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;finest&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the good old advertising days are gone forever and so are the words. Today you find comparatives, not superlatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading more of her this morning and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop. There is a joy in her words, an aliveness, that is contagious. I feel as though she does not want to stop writing, and thus, perhaps, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics vary wildly from why armed forces wear uniforms to the paucity of &amp;lsquo;growth&amp;rsquo; as the prevailing metaphor for our entire way of being and doing. No matter the details though, I want to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ursula K. Le Guin Appreciation Post</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading her book right now, No Time To Spare, and am filled with this familiar feeling of how it feels when you&amp;rsquo;re reading someone and just feel&amp;hellip;seen. Understood, yes, but more than that, like your own way of understanding itself is being reflected back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, she&amp;rsquo;s just smart and I like how her brain moves ideas around, how it thinks and how she shares that thinking with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
